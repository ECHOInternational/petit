## About The Author(s)

![ECHO Inc.](http://static.squarespace.com/static/516da119e4b00686219e2473/t/51e95357e4b0db0cdaadcb4d/1407936664333/?format=1500w)

This is an open-source project built by ECHO, an international nonprofit working to help those who are teaching farmers around the world know how to be more effective in producing enough to meet the needs of their families and their communities. ECHO is an information hub for international development practitioners specifically focused on sustainable, small-scale, agriculture. Through educational programs, publications, and networking ECHO is sharing solutions from around the world that are solving hunger problems.

Charity Navigator ranks ECHO as the #1 International Charity in the state of Florida (where their US operations are based) and among the top 100 in the US.

Thanks to grants and donations from people like you, ECHO is able to connect trainers and farmers with valuable (and often hard-to-find) resources. One of ECHO's greatest resources is the network of development practitioners, around the globe, that share help and specialized knowledge with each other. ECHO uses the YourMembership product to help facilitate these connections.
